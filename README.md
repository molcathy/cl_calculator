## Project Goals
1.	The user can enter the equation (or a polynomial) as a string and the program will translate and slice elements of that string, putting it together into a format that the computer understands.
2.	On the interface/screen of the program you can have buttons that make it easier to navigate through the program, such as:
    1.	Clearing the screen
    2.	Home button, allows you to go to the default screen which is the screen where the equation is entered
    3.	Display Button, to display the equation that is written
    4.	Storage button, that allows you to bring and use in the calculator
    5.	Formula buttons to apply to the equation given (integration, differentiation, y intersection points etc.)
    6.	The number of graphs to hold and display
    7.	Picking a point to show the coordinates of
    8.	Saving a graph
3.	To apply formulas on the equation that the computer understands such as:
    1.	Integration
    2.	Differentiation
    3.	Area underneath a graph
    4.	Displaying a point on the graph
    5.	Figuring out the tangent
    6.	Figuring out the normal
    7.	Figuring out the perpendicular bisector
    8.	Figuring out the minimum and maximum (or there might be a minimum turning point and a maximum turning point depending on the graph)
    9.	Figuring out the asymptote
    10.	Where graphs intersect
    11.	Where the y-intersect is
    12.	Where the x-intersect is
    13.	Doing a graph to any power
    14.	Drawing a graph with a positive or negative gradient
    15.	Scaling the graph to fit the space given
    16.	Only allowing the values to be drawn that are inside the graph
4.	To clear the screen
5.	To have a screen where you can save and upload polynomials and equations of a line so that the user can pull it up and use it again.
6.	To be able to hold up to 5 lines or curves
7.	To have a simple and easy design that makes it easy for the user to navigate within the program:
    1.	buttons at the top of the screen
    2.	always being able to go back to the home screen regardless of where you are
    3.	clear navigation buttons,
    4.	clear: delete, reset and save buttons
    5.	have the buttons large enough
    6.	have the buttons evenly spaced out enough
    7.	make sure for the display the graph is properly scaled
8.	Making sure the program can properly handle any errors of entering information:
    1.	Incorrect letters and symbols
    2.	Entering nothing
    3.	Entering things in the wrong format
9.	Where you save the equations of a line to have a format where you can click to pick 1 to 5 from a list of saved files of equations of a line as a list, then to click a ‘use’ button which automatically directs you to the home page with all of the equations of the line displayed and you can now use.
10.	When you have multiple equations of a line displayed:
    1.	You can see each equation displayed one beneath each other on the home page
    2.	When you want to apply a formula to an equation of a line, you click on the equation of the line you want to apply it to and then the button 1f the formula you want to apply.
    3.	For displaying you automatically highlight intersection points, you can also pick from the homepage which equations you want to display.
